= Progressive Organization POM

== Introduction

The Progressive Organization POM is a pom project for Apache Maven. It implements
a so called "Company" or "Organizational POM", by locking down the versions of Maven 
plugins and further configuration. This is an important best practice for any 
organization using Maven.

It is called "progressive" because we are trying to keep up to date with the latest 
releases of all the referenced plugins. This is done with the belief that each new 
release of a plugin brings more good features and bug fixes than bad ones. New versions 
are therefore an improvement worth adopting. This is done even if this early adoption 
ends up finding issues in the belief that finding issues early by adopting new 
versions soon gets them fixed earlier.

== Usage

The pom is deployed to the Central Repository and can therefore be used by just adding
the following snippet to your project pom.xml file.

[source,xml]
----
<parent>
  <groupId>com.simpligility.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>progressive-organization-pom</artifactId>
  <version>5.0.0</version>
</parent>
----

Once you have done that, you can reference any plugin without a version and will 
inherit the latest version automatically from the Progressive Organization POM 
e.g. like that

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.simpligility.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>android-maven-plugin</artifactId>
</plugin>
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
</plugin>

----

If, for some reason (unlikely but possible), you can not adopt the latest version 
of a specific plugin, you can and should still use this project as a parent pom 
and just override the one plugin version that is the offender. If you encounter 
this situation be sure to report the issue with the respective plugin.

The same applies for any plugin configuration inherited from this pom.


== Project Versioning and Updates

The first publicly announced release was 1.0.0. Following versions will always
use http://semver.org[semantic versioning]. Whenever one of the referenced 
plugins upgrades a major version, this project will upgrade major version by one. 
The same process will be followed with minor as well as bugfix versions. 
We also aim for a regular release schedule aiming initially for at least every 3 
months, ideally every month, as well as ad hoc releases whenever often used plugins
provide important updates.

of a useful plugin in an issue is a welcome help. 

== Development

You can check for new plugins and versions with

----
mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
mvn versions:display-property-updates
----

Deployment and release are done the usual Maven way..

----
mvn clean deploy
----

and 

----
mvn release:prepare release:perform
----

This does the full release and deployment to the Central Repository.
